# ImageBoard
You can upload your pictures, name it, give it a description and a hashtag to find more pictures with the same #.
Every user can delete the picture, comment to a picture, give replies to comments. Other features: Show a bigger picture, link to other hashtags, and slide (next,previous image) through all images, Pagination. I used the Webframework VUE.
